# Data Structures and Algorithms

Welcome to the world of Data Structures and Algorithms! As a beginner, let's explore some fundamental concepts and their implementations in JavaScript.

## Core Data Structures

### 1. Arrays

An array is a collection of elements stored in contiguous memory locations. It allows easy access to elements using an index.

#### Operations:

- **Insertion:**
  ```javascript
  let array = [1, 2, 3];
  array.push(4); // Insert at the end
  array.splice(1, 0, 5); // Insert at index 1
  ```

- **Deletion:**
  ```javascript
  array.pop(); // Remove from the end
  array.splice(1, 1); // Remove element at index 1
  ```

- **Traversal:**
  ```javascript
  for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
      console.log(array[i]);
  }
  ```

### 2. Linked Lists

A linked list is a collection of nodes, each containing data and a reference to the next node.

#### Types:

- **Singly Linked List:** Each node points to the next node.
- **Doubly Linked List:** Each node points to the next and previous nodes.
- **Circular Linked List:** The last node points back to the first node.

#### Operations:

- **Insertion:**
  ```javascript
  class Node {
      constructor(data) {
          this.data = data;
          this.next = null;
      }
  }

  let newNode = new Node(6);
  newNode.next = current.next;
  current.next = newNode;
  ```

- **Deletion:**
  ```javascript
  previous.next = current.next;
  ```

#### Example:

  ```javascript
  class Node {
      constructor(data) {
          this.data = data;
          this.next = null;
      }
  }

  let node1 = new Node(1);
  let node2 = new Node(2);
  let node3 = new Node(3);

  node1.next = node2;
  node2.next = node3;

  let currentNode = node1;
  while (currentNode) {
      console.log(currentNode.data);
      currentNode = currentNode.next;
  }
  ```

### 3. Stacks

A stack is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure.

#### Operations:

- **Push:**
  ```javascript
  let stack = [];
  stack.push(7);
  ```

- **Pop:**
  ```javascript
  let element = stack.pop();
  ```

#### Applications:

- Function calls
- Expression evaluation

### 4. Queues

A queue is a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure.

#### Operations:

- **Enqueue:**
  ```javascript
  let queue = [];
  queue.push(8);
  ```

- **Dequeue:**
  ```javascript
  let element = queue.shift();
  ```

#### Special:

Priority queues assign priorities to elements.

### 5. Trees

A tree is a hierarchical structure with a root and nodes.

#### Types:

- **Binary Tree:** Each node has at most two children.
- **Binary Search Tree (BST):** Left child is less than the parent, and the right child is greater.
- **AVL Tree:** A self-balancing binary search tree.

#### Applications:

Organizing hierarchical data.

#### Example:

  ```javascript
  class TreeNode {
      constructor(data) {
          this.data = data;
          this.left = null;
          this.right = null;
      }
  }

  let root = new TreeNode(10);
  root.left = new TreeNode(5);
  root.right = new TreeNode(15);
  ```

### 6. Graphs

A graph consists of vertices connected by edges.

#### Representations:

- **Adjacency Matrix:**
  ```javascript
  let graphMatrix = [
      [0, 1, 0],
      [1, 0, 1],
      [0, 1, 0]
  ];
  ```

- **Adjacency List:**
  ```javascript
  let graphList = {
      0: [1],
      1: [0, 2],
      2: [1]
  };
  ```

#### Algorithms:

- **BFS (Breadth-First Search):**
  ```javascript
  function bfs(graph, start) {
      let visited = new Set();
      let queue = [start];

      while (queue.length > 0) {
          let node = queue.shift();
          if (!visited.has(node)) {
              console.log(node);
              visited.add(node);
              queue.push(...graph[node]);
          }
      }
  }
  ```

### 7. Hashing

Hashing involves mapping data using hash functions.

#### Collisions:

Collisions, when two different data points hash to the same value, can be resolved by:
- **Chaining:** Storing a linked list of elements at each hash bucket.
- **Open Addressing:** Searching for the next open slot in the hash table.

#### Example:

```javascript
class HashTable {
    constructor() {
        this.table = new Array(10); // Assuming 10 buckets
    }

    hashFunction(key) {
        // Simple hash function for demonstration purposes
        return key % 10;
    }

    insert(key, value) {
        const index = this.hashFunction(key);
        if (!this.table[index]) {
            this.table[index] = [{ key, value }];
        } else {
            this.table[index].push({ key, value });
        }
    }

    search(key) {
        const index = this.hashFunction(key);
        if (!this.table[index]) {
            return null; // Key not found
        }

        for (const entry of this.table[index]) {
            if (entry.key === key) {
                return entry.value; // Found the value
            }
        }

        return null; // Key not found
    }
}

let hashTable = new HashTable();
hashTable.insert(42, 'Alice');
let result = hashTable.search(42); // Returns 'Alice'
```

    while (low <= high) {
        let mid = Math.floor((low + high) / 2);
        if (arr[mid] === target) return mid;
        if (arr[mid] < target) low = mid + 1;
        else high = mid - 1;
